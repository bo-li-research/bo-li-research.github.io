[What is a postdeadline talk?](https://www.osa.org/en-us/help/faqs/answers/what_is_the_difference_between_a_postdeadline_subm/)
Postdeadline submissions are not an opportunity to submit a paper after the published deadline, but are intended to provide those with late-breaking work an opportunity to submit that work for consideration. Postdeadline submissions should describe new and significant material in rapidly advancing areas. A limited number of postdeadline submissions will be selected for presentation, and only those papers judged to be truly excellent and compelling in their timeliness will be accepted.
