### Special Issue Information
<br/>
Dear Colleagues,
<br/>
Adaptive optics (AO) have become a big success in the field of Astronomy, being used to correct the wavefront distortion induced by atmosphere propagating. In the biomedical imaging field, AO is becoming an ever more commonplace technology for microscopy, leading to aberration-free imaging. A series of advances on both devices and controlling methods have been made in the past decades to make AO more impactful in biomedical imaging.
<br/><br/>
This Special Issue will focus on a comprehensive study on AO technology spanning analyzing methods, optical systems, and microscopy applications. Original research articles and perspectives are welcome from multidisciplinary research fields, with focus on topics including, but not limited to:
<br/><br/>
- Novel design of AO system for biomedical optical sensing and imaging; <br/><br/>
- Analyzing methods for imaging and sensing through thick diffusive layers; <br/><br/>
- Aberration correction mechanism for operating the AO related devices, e.g., SLM and DMD; <br/><br/>
- Biomedical applications of the AO system, e.g., ophthalmology, super-resolution microscopy, OCT, laser scanning microscope (confocal and multiphoton microscope), photoacoustic tomography/microscope, optogenetics, and optical tweezers.

**Manuscript Submission Information**
<br/><br/>
Manuscripts should be submitted online at [www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com) by [registering](https://susy.mdpi.com) and [logging](https://login.mdpi.com/login?_target_path=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2Fuser%2Flogin%3FauthAll%3Dtrue) in to this website. Once you are registered, [click here to go to the submission form](https://login.mdpi.com/login?_target_path=https%3A%2F%2Fsusy.mdpi.com%2Fuser%2Flogin%3FauthAll%3Dtrue). Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.
<br/>
Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/photonics/instructions) page. [Photonics](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/photonics) is an international peer-reviewed open access quarterly journal published by MDPI.
<br/>
Please visit the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/photonics/instructions) page before submitting a manuscript. The [Article Processing Charge (APC)](https://www.mdpi.com/about/apc) for publication in this [open access](https://www.mdpi.com/about/openaccess) journal is 1400 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's [English editing service](https://www.mdpi.com/authors/english) prior to publication or during author revisions.
