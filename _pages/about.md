Bo Li received Ph.D. training in telecommunication and additional postdoc training in fabrication of femtosecond fiber laser and multiphoton laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy for biology, e.g. brain research. 

With the interdisciplinary background, Bo is excited about several directions:
1. Use the mature telecommunication concepts for improvement of lasers.
2. Develop femtosecond, smart lasers for multiphoton laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy.
3. With the new capability from novel lasers and microscopy, we conduct brain research, such as neural plasticity and circuits, for understanding of the fundamental principle or medical applications.



Biography:
------
Bo Li received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication from Beijing Jiaotong University (China) and INRS-EMT (Canada), under the supervision of professors Shuqin Lou and Jose Azana, respectively, in 2015. He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cornell University (USA), under the supervision of professor Chris Xu. His recent research interests involve multi-photon laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy, femtosecond fiber laser and telecommunication. He holds to his credit more than 40 publications in top scientific journals and technical conferences, including 17 first-author contributions in high-impact peer-review journalss (such as Nature Methods, Optics Express, Journal of Lightwave Technology), and many invited and post-deadline presentations at leading international conferences.
