Bo Li received Ph.D. training in optical signal processing (telecommunication) and additional postdoc training in laser fabrication (physics) and multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy for brain research (biology). With the interdisciplinary background, Bo is excited about several directions:

1. Use the mature telecommunication concepts to improve lasers and optical microscopy.
2. With the new capability from novel lasers and microscopy, we conduct brain research, such as neural plasticity and circuits.
3. The understanding of neural circuits further helps our research on computing and telecommunication.



Biography:
------
Bo Li received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication from Beijing Jiaotong University (China) and Institut National de la Recherche Scientifiqueâ€”Energie, Materiaux et Telecommunications (INRS-EMT, Canada), under the supervision of Profs. Shuqin Lou and Jose Azana, in 2015. He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cornell University (USA), under the supervision of Prof. Chris Xu. His recent research interests involve optical microscopy, telecommunication and combination of two fields, and specifically include multiphoton microscopy, fiber optics, generation of femtosecond optical pulses, ultrafast optical signal processing and microwave photonics. He has to his credit >40 publications in top scientific journals and technical conferences, including 16 first-author contributions in high-impact peer-review journals (such as Nature Methods, Optics letters, Optics Express, Journal of lightwave Technology, and etc.), and many invited and post-deadline presentations in leading international meetings.
