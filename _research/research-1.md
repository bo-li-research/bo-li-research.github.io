We demonstrate a multi-color background-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging system, using a robust, all-fiber, low-cost, multi-wavelength timelens source. The time-lens source generates picosecond pulse trains at three different wavelengths. The first is 1064.3 nm, the second is tunable between 1052 nm and 1055 nm, and the third is tunable between 1040 nm and 1050 nm. When the time-lens source is synchronized with a mode-locked Ti:Sa laser, two of the three wavelengths are used to detect different Raman frequencies for two-color on-resonance imaging, whereas the third wavelength is used to obtain the off-resonance image for nonresonant background subtraction. Mixed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) beads are used to demonstrate two-color background-free CARS imaging. The synchronized multiwavelength time-lens source enables pixel-to-pixel wavelength-switching. We demonstrate simultaneous two-color CARS imaging of CH2 and CH3 stretching vibration modes with realtime background subtraction in ex vivo mouse tissue.
